However, diving deeper and analysing the shots' distance- and angle-distribution showed that this was due to the fact that strong-foot-shots tended to be taken from a higher distance and a worse angle than those with the weak foot or head/body. Eliminating this factor and comparing the bodyparts' goal-rates in each separate distance-/angle-category, we can conclude that the strong foot has the highest specific goal-rate, followed by the weak foot shots and headers/bodyshots."
